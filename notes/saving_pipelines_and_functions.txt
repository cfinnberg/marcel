Saving pipelines and functions

This doesn't work very well. It's always a problem, most recently bug
234.

Only explicitly assigned vars are now persisted (in env.pickle), so
the current iteration of the problem is due to assigned functions and
pipelines, e.g. 

    x = (lambda: lambda x: x + 1)

    fn = (| n: gen (int(n)) |)

(Vars are also assigned via import, store, and load, and these special
cases already work.)

So for vars assigned function (callable() yields True) and pipeline
values (PipelineExecutable)

- Value is 

        class Compilable
          - source
          - compiled

- env.getvar compiles if needed and caches the result in compiled.

- When persisting env: Clear the caches
