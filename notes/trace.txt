Trace facility

- Print op and input

- Need ops to identify themselves clearly, to distinguish from other
  ops of the same type within a command.

- What about between commands? Maybe dump the entire command on start
  and end of execution.

- Try to keep trace logic in core Op, but this may not always be
  possible (e.g. Write.receive_error)

- trace op to control

  - Whether trace is on
  - Where to write output (stdout, file)

- What about

  - Remote execution: Send trace config to farcel? Can results from
    there be integrated with local trace?

  - Anything run through ForkManager


trace op:

      trace # prints trace status
      trace -s|--stdout
      trace -f|--file FILE
      trace -o|--off


Bugs:

Preserve tracing across reconfig
